// that much on every turn first. Base64 makes the wire size about 4/3 of this,
// leaving the rest of a provider's limit for text.

// time. Every image has a fixed position — the image bytes, and the image
// count, before it — and an image is dropped when it starts before the cut,
// a multiple of the step, just far enough in to bring the total within
// budget. The cut stays where it is until a step's worth of new images has
