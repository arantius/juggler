// oldest unanswered registration, or held it as the one answer waiting for the
// next. While an answer is already held it blocks, so a feeder looping on inject
// runs exactly one reply ahead per slot instead of spinning and queueing without
// bound. One held answer per slot is enough for a caller that queues a context
// and a tools reply serially before dispatching the turn. It returns false if
// abort or the worker's done closes first.
