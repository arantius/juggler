/**
 * What a conversation with no history says before its first message: the four
 * composer gestures a first-time user has no way to guess, then one rolling tip
 * ({@link module:components/empty-hint-tips}) for everything past the composer.
 *
 * Two places show it, and exactly one of them at a time. A conversation with
 * nothing to ask floats it over the empty background (`conversation-empty-hint`,
 * positioned from {@link module:components/conversation-area}); a conversation
 * still being asked where it works carries it inside the setup card instead, so
 * the question and the instructions read as one block. Both take the stack from
 * here, because two copies of the same four lines is how the overlay and the
 * card start disagreeing about what the composer does.
 *
 * It is read every time a conversation is opened before its first message, so it
 * stays plain instruction rather than voice; the composer's own placeholder
 * carries that.
 * @module components/empty-hint-stack

/**
 * The hint's content as one block.
 *
 * The key glyphs come from the shortcut formatter, so they read ↵ / ⇧↵ on macOS
 * and Enter / Shift+Enter elsewhere. Neither row is true on a touch composer,
 * where Enter inserts a newline and sending is a button — those rows and the
 * drag-and-drop line are hidden by the same `(hover: none) and (pointer:
 * coarse)` media query the composer keys its behaviour off.
 *
 * Everything sits in one `.empty-hint-stack` so the overlay's fit test can
 * measure the content as a single block.
 * @returns {string} The stack's markup.
