/**
 * The top of a workspace's box in the tab bar: what the place is called.
 *
 * It is the workspace's own row, not any conversation's, and a name is nearly
 * all of what a strip two hundred pixels wide can say about a place. Everything
 * else true of the tree — where it is, how it is doing, and the ways of
 * finishing with it — is <workspace-panel>'s, shown when the box is selected,
 * where there is room to read it and to aim at it. A header carrying all of
 * that was a title, a status line and two buttons in the width of a tab.
 *
 * The one exception is uncommitted work, which stays here as a dot beside the
 * name: it is the state that decides whether an ending costs anything, it is
 * worth a mark rather than a word, and a mark fits. That is the whole reason
 * this still asks the provider anything.
